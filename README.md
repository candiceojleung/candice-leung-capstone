# Project Title

## Overview

What is your app? Give a brief description in a couple of sentences.

### Problem Space

Misdiagnosis is a significant issue in women's health, particularly concerning reproductive health conditions. Medical education has historically been centered on male physiology, leading to gaps in understanding female-specific conditions. This results in symptoms being overlooked or misattributed. Furthermore women's health symptoms are frequently dismissed as stress, hormonal changes, or psychological issues.

1 in 4 women (24%) surveyed experienced a misdiagnosis of a gynaecological condition, including endometriosis, PCOS, pregnancy, ovarian cysts, and period pain. Endometriosis is the most frequently misdiagnosed gynaecological condition, affecting nearly 1 in 10 women. 75.2% of endometriosis patients reported being misdiagnosed with another physical health (95.1%) and/or mental health problem (49.5%). PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) is also highly correlated with disorders such as Type 2 diabetes, increased risk of heart disease, sleep apnea, and mood disorders. 

### User Profile

The web application can really be used by all women who may be experiencing reproductive, physical health or mental health conditions. Users can choose which page they'd like to navigate to add in symptoms and can simply utilize the ones that are applicable to them. The app will make note on days where symptoms are most severe. This ensures users can accurately display information to medical professionals and observe trends throughout their usage of the application. 


### Features

List the functionality that your app will include. These can be written as user stories or descriptions with related details. Do not describe _how_ these features are implemented, only _what_ needs to be implemented.

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

List technologies that will be used in your app, including any libraries to save time or provide more functionality. Be sure to research any potential limitations.

### APIs

List any external sources of data that will be used in your app.

### Sitemap

List the pages of your app with brief descriptions. You can show this visually, or write it out.

### Mockups

Provide visuals of your app's screens. You can use pictures of hand-drawn sketches, or wireframing tools like Figma.

### Data

Describe your data and the relationships between the data points. You can show this visually using diagrams, or write it out. 

### Endpoints

List endpoints that your server will implement, including HTTP methods, parameters, and example responses.

## Roadmap

Scope your project as a sprint. Break down the tasks that will need to be completed and map out timeframes for implementation working back from the capstone due date.

## Future Implementations
Your project will be marked based on what you committed to in the above document. Here, you can list any additional features you may complete after the MVP of your application is built, or if you have extra time before the Capstone due date.
